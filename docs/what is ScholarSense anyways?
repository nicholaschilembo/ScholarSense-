Educational institutions face challenges in identifying students who may be at risk of academic underperformance or dropout and providing timely interventions to support their educational journey. Traditional methods rely on standardized tests, grades, and teacher observations, which may not capture the full spectrum of student characteristics and predictors of academic success. There is a need for a data-driven approach that can objectively classify students into different performance groups and forecast their academic outcomes, enabling educators and administrators to implement targeted interventions and support services to enhance student retention and success rates.
